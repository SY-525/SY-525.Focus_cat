🐾 Focus Cat Extension

Focus Cat is a productivity Chrome extension that keeps you on task by unleashing mischievous cats whenever you try to slack off.
When you open distracting websites, animated cats pounce onto your screen, block your view, and even multiply if you linger too long. Stay focused — or face the feline wrath!

------------------------------------------
✨ Features

  🐱 Screen-blocking cats – playful (and sometimes angry) cats appear when you open blacklisted websites.

  ⚡ Dynamic animations – cats can attack, run, or spawn in multiples depending on your activity.

  🎯 Customizable site blocking – choose which sites to block or allow.

  🎨 Cute, lightweight UI – smooth animations without slowing your browser.
