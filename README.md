🐾 Focus Cat Extension

Focus Cat is a productivity Chrome extension that keeps you on task by unleashing mischievous cats whenever you try to slack off.
When you open distracting websites, animated cats pounce onto your screen, block your view, and even multiply if you linger too long. Stay focused — or face the feline wrath!

  🎯 Customizable site blocking – choose which sites to block or allow.

  🎨 Cute, lightweight UI – smooth animations without slowing your browser.
